				Pianist, composer, and artist Jason Moran hails from Houston, TX. He studied with Jaki Byard at the Manhattan School of Music and with Andrew Hill and Muhal Richard Abrams upon graduation. Moran’s 18-year relationship with Blue Note Records produced 9 highly acclaimed recordings. His groundbreaking trio, The Bandwagon (with bassist Tarus Mateen and drummer Nasheet Waits) is currently celebrating their 20th anniversary. Recent awards and fellowships include the MacArthur Foundation, US Artists, Doris Duke Foundation and Ford Foundation. Moran collaborated with his wife, the mezzo-soprano/composer Alicia Hall Moran, as named artists in the 2012 Whitney Biennial (BLEED) and for the 2015 Venice Biennial (Work Songs) and Carnegie Hall (Two Wings: The Music of Black America in Migration). Since his first album, he has produced fourteen additional albums, created scores for Ava DuVernay’s films Selma and 13th, and author Ta-Nehisi Coates’ staged and upcoming film adaptation of Between the World and Me. In 2018, Moran’s first solo museum exhibition opened at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and traveled to the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Moran is currently the Artistic Director for Jazz at The Kennedy Center, teaches at New England Conservatory and curates the Artist’s Studio series for Park Avenue Armory in New York City.
